# **Squid-Game**

Welcome to Squid Game: Attack Of The Shapes!

This game was inspired from a Hackathon Project that I did with a group of others during the pandemic. The original was Surfing Turtles where a turtle would try to avoid falling obstacles, hence "Surfing". This one is themed Squid Game, a popular South-Korean Survival drama series on Netflix. In the show, the contestants would be fighting for their lives, but in this game, the guards are trying to survive instead.

I decided to take it a step further by making another version of Surfing Turtles but with heavily-improved UI and functionality. Plus it looks better.

Language: Python
Modules: Turtle, Random, Tkinter

Turtle helps with placement of the character and the enemies, and writing the text onto the screen.
Tkinter helps with the UI, with a variety of different components. I mainly used the buttons.

**Note:**
Keep in mind, I am running MacOS, so here is how I ran it on Mac.

## Terminal
1. Download the zip file for this project and extract it.
2. Open Terminal
3. Navigate to the project directory by using:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/directory/Squid-Game
   ```
4. Ensure that Pip and Python are installed:
  - You may need to install pip from the web if you do not have it.
  - If you have pip but not Python:
    - ```bash
      pip install python3
      ```
5. Once Python is install, you can run it!
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
6. A screen should pop up with the program loaded.

## On VSCode or IDE
1. Simply open the file directory when loading up the IDE.
2. Click the run button in the top-right corner.
3. A file should open with the program loaded.
