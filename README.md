### **Squid-Game**

Welcome to Squid Game: Attack Of The Shapes!

This game was inspired from a Hackathon Project that I did with a group of others during the pandemic. The original was Surfing Turtles where a turtle would try to avoid falling obstacles, hence "Surfing". This one is themed Squid Game, a popular South-Korean Survival drama series on Netflix. In the show, the contestants would be fighting for their lives, but in this game, the guards are trying to survive instead.

I decided to take it a step further by making another version of Surfing Turtles but with heavily-improved UI and functionality. Plus it looks better.

Language: Python
Modules: Turtle, Random, Tkinter

Turtle helps with placement of the character and the enemies, and writing the text onto the screen.
Tkinter helps with the UI, with a variety of different components. I mainly used the buttons.

Keep in mind, I am running MacOS, so here is how I ran it on Mac.
